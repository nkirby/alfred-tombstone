## Tombstone Workflow

Ever want to make a tombstone right from the excellent Alfred app for mac? Now you can.

Syntax is simple, if a bit cranky:

```
tombstone <line> | <line> | <line>
```

This should support up to 4 lines, and should make a reasonable attempt at escaping bad input, but don't quote me on that.
